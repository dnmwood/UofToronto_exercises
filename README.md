## University of Toronto Python Exercises

This is where I will be uploading any Python3 exercises during my time at U of T, where I am currently sitting in on CS108 as well as taking the online Coursera course in order to take part in online exercises.

I'll still be working on my primary Ruby projects when I find time, but for now it is pretty imperative that I take the time to learn the ins and outs of coding at a University level. Good luck, me!

### Exercise 3.1

Started out easy enough, the math I could do in my head or on paper - but figuring out how to write it as code gave me more of a challenge. At first I assumed it would be something to do with remainders (%) but quickly figured out that the best solution is often the simplest one (h - 40).

**What I Learned:**
Constants are important! The number 40 never changes, and it's not always a bad thing to just put a number into your code that isn't a variable - which was the last step for me in figuring out this exercise.
