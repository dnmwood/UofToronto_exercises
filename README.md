## University of Toronto Python Exercises

This is where I will be uploading any Python3 exercises during my time at U of T, where I am currently sitting in on CS108 as well as taking the online Coursera course in order to take part in online exercises.

I'll still be working on my primary Ruby projects when I find time, but for now it is pretty imperative that I take the time to learn the ins and outs of coding at a University level. Good luck, me!
